# Crow Discord Bot Improvements Implementation Summary

We've implemented the following improvements to the Crow Discord Bot:

## 1. Channel-Specific Message History

- Modified `get_recent_messages()` to accept an optional `channel_id` parameter
- Added SQL filtering to retrieve messages only from the specified channel
- Updated all calls to include the current channel ID when retrieving context

## 2. Case-Sensitive Channel Names

- Changed the channel name comparison from case-insensitive to exact matching
- Modified the `find_channels_by_name` function to use exact string comparison
- This ensures that users can specify the exact channel name they want to follow

## 3. Configurable Context Messages

- Added a new configuration option `gemini_context_messages` to control how many messages are included
- Added a field to the `Bot` struct to store the configured value
- Updated the `GeminiClient` constructor to accept this parameter
- Modified all calls to `get_recent_messages()` to use the configured value
- Maintained the existing logic to reverse the order of messages (oldest first)

## 4. Separate Interjection Probabilities

- Added configuration options for each interjection type:
  - `INTERJECTION_MST3K_PROBABILITY`
  - `INTERJECTION_MEMORY_PROBABILITY`
  - `INTERJECTION_PONDERING_PROBABILITY`
  - `INTERJECTION_AI_PROBABILITY`
- Added fields to the `Bot` struct to store these probabilities
- Completely rewrote the interjection logic to check each type independently
- Set default probabilities to 0.5% (1 in 200) for each type

These improvements make the bot more configurable and provide better context-aware responses in multi-channel environments.

Note: The implementation of the separate interjection probabilities feature is still in progress due to some syntax issues in the code that need to be resolved.
